## Tips-And-Tricks

* [Is it possible to disable lsp formatting temporarily?](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/oo8jcu/is_it_possible_to_disable_lsp_formatting/)
   You can avoid all autocommands with `:noa w`, or ignore some (or all) for some time with `:set eventignore=BufWritePre`.

## TreeSitter

TreeSitter in `nvim` is used for better syntax highlighting.

Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library.
It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited.
Tree-sitter aims to be:
* General enough to parse any programming language
* Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
* Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
* Dependency-free so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

### nvim-treesitter-textobjects

[github](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects):
Syntax aware text-objects, select, move, swap, and peek support.


### nvim-treesitter-context

[github](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-context):
Show the function you are in at the top of the buffer.

A Vim plugin that shows the context of the currently visible buffer contents.
It's supposed to work on a wide range of file types, but is probably most useful when looking at source code files.
In most programming languages this context will show you which function you're looking at, and within that function which loops or conditions are surrounding the visible code.

## mason.nvim

[github](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim):
Portable package manager for Neovim that runs everywhere Neovim runs.
Easily install and manage LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters.

`:h mason-introduction`

`mason.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily manage external editor tooling such as LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters through a single interface.
It runs everywhere Neovim runs (across Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.), with only a small set of [external requirements](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim#requirements) needed.

Packages are installed in Neovim's data directory (`:h standard-path`) by default.
Executables are linked to a single `bin/` directory, which `mason.nvim` will add to Neovim's PATH during setup, allowing seamless access from Neovim builtins (shell, terminal, etc.) as well as other 3rd party plugins.

For a list of all available packages, see https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list.

## cmp-nvim-lsp

[github](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp):
nvim-cmp source for neovim builtin LSP client.

Language servers provide different completion results depending on the capabilities of the client.
Neovim's default omnifunc has basic support for serving completion candidates.
`nvim-cmp` supports more types of completion candidates, so users must override the capabilities sent to the server such that it can provide these candidates during a completion request.
These capabilities are provided via the helper function `require('cmp_nvim_lsp').default_capabilities`

As these candidates are sent on each request, adding these capabilities will break the built-in omnifunc support for neovim's language server client.
`nvim-cmp` provides manually triggered completion that can replace omnifunc.
See `:help cmp-faq` for more details.
